## Project Overview

In today's rapidly changing technological landscape, it's crucial to harness the power of technology to simplify and streamline tasks. The Housing Community Management System is designed to address the challenges faced in managing a housing community. It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to oversee occupancy and track maintenance fees, allows occupants to make payments, and enables new users to explore and book houses.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To generate a block-wise list of occupied and unoccupied houses.
- To provide administrators with a view of block-wise occupancy details and maintenance fee status.
- To facilitate monthly maintenance fee payments for occupants.
- To allow new users to create accounts and view available houses.
- To enable new users to book houses based on BHK type and price.

## Features

The Housing Community Management System includes three modules:

1. **Administrator Module**: Allows system administrators to view occupancy details, payment status, and manage occupant records.

2. **Occupant Module**: Enables occupants to log in and pay their monthly maintenance fees securely.

3. **New User Module**: Allows new users to create accounts, explore available houses, and book houses that meet their criteria.

## Usage
